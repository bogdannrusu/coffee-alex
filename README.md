# React Coffee Website for a little business
 I'm a coffee enthusiast and I want to create a website for my small coffee shop.
 I want to create a website that showcases my coffee shop, a place where customers can order online, make reservations, and learn more about my coffee shop.
 I want to use React for this project because it's a popular and powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces
